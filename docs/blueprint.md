## Core Features:

- Session Logging: Log daily training sessions, including date, time, and location.
- Session Details: Record details of each session, such as exercises performed, horse's behavior, and any challenges encountered.
- Progress Tracking: Visually track the horse's progress over time with charts and graphs based on session data. Show a basic trendline.
- AI Session Analysis: Use an AI tool to analyze session notes and identify patterns or potential issues in the horse's training. The tool identifies key topics in the session notes, so the trainer can later filter training sessions by topic.

## Original User Request:
I would like to create an app for horse training. TO be able to resgister my sesions with my unbroke horses and see if this can help other people too. To make a job as horse training a simple and fun task to do daily.
This should track how the horse is progressing. Depending in which state it is. And also it will be use full to track down when you encounter a difficulty and how did you solve it.
Later on this app can have further features.
